*namespace is the logical container for datatypes.
*we can define 4 things at any class or structure : attributes(variables) , function , property , event(pointer function)-->put fun in variable.
*default access level in struct in C# is private.
*internal:a new accessable level at c# , means variable is accessable inside the assemply file inside the same project
*for project to see or access another project:
 -Right click on refrences(dependencies)
 -choose projects(solution)
 -choose project
*default access modifier inside namespace is internal so to use class/struct from one project in onether you should define them with public
~OVERLOADING:is a type of polymerphism,you create many function with the same name in the same class but work in diffrent ways,signature is diffrent
 ,no keywords used,no need for inheritence it is happen in the same class.
~OVERRIDING: the functions have the same name and signature but in diffrent classes,we use virtual keyword for the base class and override keyword for 
 the derived class,need inheritence it happen in the derived class.
